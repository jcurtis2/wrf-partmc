Configuring and building WRF-PartMC
-----------------------------------



git clone https://github.com/jcurtis2/wrf_partmc.git
git submodule update --init partmc

If you have access to mosaic,

git submodule update --init mosaic

To compile with MOSAIC, set the environmental variable

   export MOSAIC=1


Description of the directories:

- WPS is the WRF preprocessor that creates the inputs for WRF (version 3.9.1)
- WRF is the meteorology model and is a modified version of 3.9.1.
    NOTE: WPS and WRF should match in version number.
- PartMC is a branch named wrf_partmc. Changes on this branch will be merged to
    master at a later date with preprocessor directive PMC_USE_WRF
- mozbc/ takes wrfinput and wrfbdy from ./real.exe and populates these files with
    values from the MOZART output.
- emissions/ contains the program to create WRF-PartMC emissions from SMOKE
    source-apportioned data
- boundary_and_initial_conditions/ contains programs to create initial and
    boundary conditions from the wrfinput and wrfbdy files using MOZART global
    model output.
- interface/ is all the code required to interface WRF with PartMC
- mosaic/ is the chemistry code
- scenarios/ contains any future scenarios developed
- gridding/ includes methods for aligning grids

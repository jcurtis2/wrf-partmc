em_rotational test case:

For compiling this test case, users must add -DPMC_CONSTANT_VEL to ENVCOMPDEFS in
configure.wrf after configuring.

This test case is a Gaussian cone advected by solid body rotational wind field 
counterclockwise. Each vertical level in the domain is an individual ensemble member
as vertical transport is entirely disabled such that this is truly a 2D case.
